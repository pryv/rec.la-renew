# rec.la files

Loopback domain and SSL certs.


## Why ?

At [Pryv](http://pryv.com) we often have to locally develop web applications that intensively use AJAX REST requests. CORS layer is enforced by pure HTTPS only policies from browsers.

This is why we refurbished a domain and its SSL certs to a full loopback domain.

This will enable any developer to benefit from a loopback signed certificate.
